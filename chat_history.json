In the context of LLMs, this typically involves reducing the precision of the model's parameters from floating-point representations (e.g., 32-bit floats) to lower-bit representations (e.g., 8-bit integers). This reduction can lead to significant improvements in memory usage and computational speed."}, {"question": "based on the HybridRAG , can you please provide 5 different use case", "response": "Answer is not available in the context."}]
